As a data engineer I want to build a test coverage report for my dbt models.

I want to focus my report in 4 dimensions:

1. Columns 
Testing Criteria: The column present in the model must be at least in one expected result in the unit test for the model

2. Aggregations
Functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN
Window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()
Testing Criteria: Having multiple input records for the column used in the function to test aggregation logic

3. Operations
Mathematical operations: +, -, *, /
Math functions: ROUND, FLOOR, CEIL, ABS, SQRT
String functions: UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTR, CONCAT, LENGTH
Date functions: TO_DATE, DATE_TRUNC, EXTRACT, DATEDIFF
Conditional logic: CASE WHEN, COALESCE, NULLIF
Type casting: ::
Testing Criteria: Having at least one input value in the column or columns used in the operation to test operation logic

4. Joins
All join types: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
Testing Criteria: Having records from multiple input tables to test join logic

The tool expects dbt unit tests in YAML files following this format:
unit_tests:
  - name: test_name
    model: model_name
    given:
      - input: ref('input_model')
        rows:
          - {col1: value1, col2: value2}
          - {col1: value3, col2: value4}  # Multiple rows for aggregation testing
    expect:
      rows:
        - {result_col: expected_value}
This format follows the dbt official documentation for unit testing: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/unit-tests.

The report should shows coverage in the format: tested/total for each dimension.
Example output:
Model                                    Columns.    Aggregations    Operations      Joins

I want you to build a python script in the scripts folder that generates this report in the terminal.
